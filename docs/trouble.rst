Troubleshooting and bug reporting
=================================

The FinTS specification is long and complicated and in many parts leaves things open to interpretation -- or sometimes
implementors interpret things differently even though they're not really open to interpretation. This is valid for us,
but also for the banks. Making the library work with many different banks is hard, and often impossible without access
to a test account. Therefore, we ask you for patience when reporting issues with different banks -- and you need to be
ready that we might not be able to help you because we do not have the time or bank account required to dig deeper.

Therefore, if you run into trouble with this library, you first need to ask yourself a very important question: **Is it
me or the library?** To answer this question for most cases, we have attached a script below, that we ask you to use
to try the affected feature of the library in a well-documented way. Apart from changing the arguments (i.e. your bank's
parameters and your credentials) at the top, we ask you **not to make any modifications**. Pasting this bit by bit into
a Jupyter notebook **is a modification**. If your issue does not include information as to whether the script below works
or does not work for your bank, **we will close your issue without further comment.**

**If the script below does not work for you**, there is probably a compatibility issue between this library and your
bank. Feel free to open an issue, but make sure the issue title includes the name of the bank and the text includes
what operations specifically fail.

**If the script below does work for you**, there is probably something wrong with your usage of the library or our
documentation. Feel free to open an issue, but **include full working example code** that is necessary to reproduce
the problem.
